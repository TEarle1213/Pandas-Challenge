# Pandas-Challenge

Analysis of data from 15 schools to determine how school type, size and budget affect passing scores in reading and math. 

Used a python IDE, Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to parse data. Source material and coding can be found in this repository. 

This data is pulled from 7 district and 8 charter schools and compares outcomes in math and reading by size of school, budget per student, and by school type. It's interesting to note that reading scores hold steady at the 80-84% range, regardless of how outcomes are categorized. Math scores, on the other hand, are notably affected by school size. At a glance, it would seem that school type also affects math scores as charter schools are outperforming district schools in this metric, however that is probably a side effect of all represented charter schools having smaller student bodies than all represented district schools. Similarly, when comparing overall passing rates between district and charter schools, the math scores are having an outsized effect. The difference between reading scores at each school type is much less notable than the gap for math scores.
