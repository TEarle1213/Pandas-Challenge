# Pandas-Challenge

Analysis of data from 15 schools to determine how school type, size and budget affect passing scores in reading and math. 

Used a python IDE, Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to parse data. Source material and coding can be found in this repository. 

This data is pulled from 7 district and 8 charter schools and compares outcomes in math and reading by size of school, budget per student, and by school type. It's interesting to note that reading scores hold steady at the 80-84% range, regardless of how outcomes are categorized. Math scores, on the other hand, are notably affected by school size. We cannot draw conclusions about class size from this data set though, as student to teacher ratios cannot be determined. 
At a glance, it would seem that school type also affects math scores as charter schools are outperforming district schools in this metric, however that may be a side effect of all represented charter schools having smaller student bodies than all represented district schools. This would need further exploration to draw actionable conclusions from. The district and charter schools closest in size are Huang (District, student pop:2917) and Wilson (Charter, student pop:2283) and Wilson does outperform Huang in math scores by significant margins.
School budget seems to have an unexpected affect on student outcomes, as higher spending per student does not correlate to better classroom scores.
